# Grand Rail Network Map

This project is intended to eventually be a grand rail network map of Kent, the
UK or the whole World!

## Implementation

The data is stored as a grid with certain values to represent different features
of the rail infrastructure.

This grid is represented in an HTML5 `canvas` element with iconography from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Route_diagram_template/Catalog_of_pictograms)

## Accuracy

The grid is designed based on latitudes and longitudes. This does not mean a
feature will necessarily be represented on the exact grid square where it is
located physically. It does however make placing far easier.
